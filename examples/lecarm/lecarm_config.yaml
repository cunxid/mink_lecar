# LeCARM Robot Configuration
# This file contains configuration parameters for the LeCARM robot

# Motor configuration
motor_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
feedback_ids: null  # If null, uses same as motor_ids
bitrate: 1000000  # CAN bus bitrate
can_interface: "can0"  # Default CAN interface

# Gravity compensation coefficients for each joint
# These coefficients scale the computed gravity compensation torques
gravity_coefficients: [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 2.35, 1.0, 1.0]

# Joint mapping directions for teleoperation
# Maps LeCARM joint indices to YAM joint indices with direction
# Format: [lecarm_joint_index: yam_joint_index, direction]
# Direction: 1 for same direction, -1 for inverted direction
# Example: {0: [0, 1], 1: [1, 1], ...} means:
#   LeCARM joint 0 -> YAM joint 0, same direction
#   LeCARM joint 1 -> YAM joint 1, same direction
joint_mapping:
  - target_joint: 0  # YAM joint index
    direction: 1     # 1 for same direction, -1 for inverted
  - target_joint: 1
    direction: 1
  - target_joint: 2
    direction: -1
  - target_joint: 3
    direction: 1
  - target_joint: 4
    direction: 1
  - target_joint: 5
    direction: 1

# Alternative format: direct mapping with directions per joint
# This allows for remapping LeCARM joints to different YAM joints if needed
# joint_directions: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # Direction multipliers for each joint
